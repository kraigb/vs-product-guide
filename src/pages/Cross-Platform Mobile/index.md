Visual Studio 2015 offers several ways to approach mobile app development.


- The [**Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova**](cordova) enables developers to use their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or TypeScript) skills to write and debug hybrid apps that require little or no platform-specific customizations.
- [**Xamarin tools**](xamarin) combined with Visual Studio empowers developers to write and debug fully native cross-platform mobile apps by using C# and .NET, with 75% to nearly 100% shared code across platforms.
- New capabilities enable Visual C++ developers to build [cross-platform C++ code](crossplatcpp) that runs on Android, iOS, and Windows, all from a shared code base.
- The [**Visual Studio Emulator for Android**](androidemulator) is based on Hyper-V, and is targetable by any Android project with configurable images such as Lollipop and KitKat.
- With the downloadable [**Visual Studio Tools for Unity**](unity) extension, game and high-performance graphics developers use C# for their Unity scripts in Visual Studio. Developers enjoy streamlined workflows and debugging in conjunction with Unity tools, which can target multiple mobile platforms from a single code base.
