## Welcome to Visual Studio 2015

Every developer and every team, any app on any platform: that is our aspiration for Visual Studio. From Microsoft's first BASIC interpreter in 1975, to the introduction of Visual C++ and Visual Studio in the mid-1990s, and now to Visual Studio 2015, Microsoft continues a long-standing dedication to help developers achieve more.

In addition to delivering many new features for web, cloud, and Windows development, our newest version, Visual Studio 2015, extends beyond traditional platforms and enables developers to target a rich set of mobile platforms including iOS, Android, and Windows. Mobile development is possible with in-box Apache Cordova platform support and C++ cross-platform library development, Xamarin for building native apps using C# and Visual Studio, and Unity for building graphics and gaming apps. And Visual Studio Code, in preview, brings a powerful editing experience to developers working on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

Developers can also take advantage of our continued investment into Python and Node.js tooling, which in combination with the open-source .NET Core provides developers with a variety of choices to build code that runs on Windows Server, Linux, or Mac OS X for server-side applications.

Modern development, too, depends on much more than just code: team agility across the entire development lifecycle is critical to the continuous delivery that customers expect. From team collaboration, to DevOps and release management, to cross-platform monitoring in production environments, the Visual Studio 2015 family—including Visual Studio Online and Team Foundation Server 2015, with new support for non-Windows platforms and third-party tools—gives teams the flexibility to create the environment they need, both in the cloud and on-premises.
